# Blurbs

Write something about me!

- Create a new markdown file (MDX supported, that means HTML, JavaScript, etc.) :+1::sunglasses:
- Name it with your name, the author.
- Write something about me, include an embed, drop a picture, share a memory, etc.
- Please promote yourself in the footer or something to sign off that you wrote the blurb :pray:
- Open a pull request! :tada:

Once the PR is merged, I'll push your blurb up to [jhey.dev](https://jhey.dev).

## Looking forward to what you write! :eyes:
