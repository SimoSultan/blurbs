# Jhey's Twitch streams are like interactive Netflix for creatives.
You're not just watching someone code, you participate, suggest crazy ideas and see them come to life.

Similar to a good, tasteful music composition, each Jhey's creative project contains these little subtleties, little delicacies that make the whole thing speak on a completely different level.

So, jump in, say "HiðŸ‘‹", and be a part of the next [awesome project for awesome people](https://www.twitch.tv/jh3yy).
